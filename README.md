A library that extends the base Javascript types by adding helper methods to the base types safely. The base types are first examined to see if a method already exists and if it does not exist, then the method is added.

Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/dbudde/typesExtended/wiki) page to learn about the available methods that are added to the base types.
